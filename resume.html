                <p>Ellie Mah is the total package of arts and engineering. Her university degree in Art Hisory has honed her eye for design and attention to detail.  Her masters in CIS gives her a deep bench of knowledge into how computers and networks work from logical gates, through assembly and C in a UNIX invironment. Her most recent bootcamp style course from Per Scholas has given her a cutting edge take on the modern MERN stack.
